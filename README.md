<h1> Smart Sustainable Mini Weather Station </h1>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p>Climate change demands seriousness and urgency. Failure in identifying which would result in putting the planet on the brink of catastrophe. Weather monitoring plays a crucial role in identifying and assessing these risks. The existing solutions are inaccurate and unreliable to an extreme extent as they do not account for localized weather conditions. Thus, the purpose of this project is to develop an interconnected system of devices, making the whole monitoring process easy, reliable, and accessible. The system provides an optimal solution by developing a weather monitoring system for a specific area rather than a large geographical area to suit the needs of farmers, industrialists, etc. The self-sustainable system is powered through solar panels making it eco-friendly. The sensors provide the readings of the surroundings which are then transferred to another node through Bluetooth.  The sensors used are DHT11, Rain sensor, UltraViolet sensor, Light Sensor, and BMP-180. ESP32 is used as the simple brain of the system.
